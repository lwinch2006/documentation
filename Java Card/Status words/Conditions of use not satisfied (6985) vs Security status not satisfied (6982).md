What's the difference between standard ISO 7816-4 SW: 0x6982 and 0x6985?

Assistant:
The status words (`SW`) in the ISO/IEC 7816 series are two-byte codes used to communicate the result of an operation performed by a smart card. Each specific status word conveys a standardized meaning. Let's break down the difference between **0x6982** and **0x6985** in the context of ISO/IEC 7816-4.

---

### **SW 0x6982: Security Status Not Satisfied**
- **Explanation**:
    - This status word indicates that the security conditions required to perform the requested operation are **not satisfied**.
    - Typically, the card requires some form of security verification (e.g., PIN entry, successful authentication, or established Secure Messaging) before continuing with the operation. Without completing these security preconditions, the card refuses the operation.

- **Scenarios**:
    - A PIN or password must be verified, but it hasn't been entered yet.
    - Cryptographic authentication has failed or has not been performed.
    - Access to the requested resource or file is restricted unless security rules are satisfied.

- **Example Use Case**:
    - A user tries to access a secured file or perform a cryptographic operation (like `PSO:CDS` for signing) without first completing required authentication steps (e.g., PIN verification or mutual authentication).

---

### **SW 0x6985: Conditions of Use Not Satisfied**
- **Explanation**:
    - This status word indicates that the conditions required to execute the requested operation are **not satisfied**, but **not necessarily related to security**.
    - It means the card's state or internal conditions prevent the command from being executed.

- **Scenarios**:
    - The requested operation isn't supported in the card's current state. For example:
        - A cryptographic key has expired or been deleted.
        - A counter required for the operation has reached its limit.
        - The card needs to be activated or personalized before the operation can be executed.
        - The file structure or data required by the command is not in the correct state.
    - The operation is restricted by logical rules or card configuration, unrelated to security.

- **Example Use Case**:
    - A user tries to sign data (e.g., `PSO:CDS`) with a key that is no longer valid or has not been initialized.
    - A "Verify" command is issued, but the maximum number of allowed retries has been exceeded, so the PIN cannot be verified.

### **Summary of the Key Differences**:

| **Status Word** | **Meaning**                               | **Main Cause**                                                                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `0x6982`         | **Security Status Not Satisfied**         | Security prerequisites (e.g., PIN verification, cryptographic authentication) are not fulfilled.         |
| `0x6985`         | **Conditions of Use Not Satisfied**       | Operation is invalid due to card state, key configuration, logical restrictions, or file/command rules.  |

By interpreting these codes, you can diagnose issues during communication with a smart card, identify what step is missing or invalid, and adjust the sequence of commands accordingly.

User:
what response should be if PIN not validated yet?

Assistant:
If the **PIN has not been validated yet**, the appropriate response from the smart card is usually the **ISO/IEC 7816-4 status word `0x6982`**, which stands for:

**`SW 0x6982: Security Status Not Satisfied`**

### Context:
The reason for this status word is that a PIN is typically required as a **security condition** to access certain protected operations, such as:
- Reading or writing sensitive files
- Performing cryptographic operations (e.g., signing with private keys)
- Managing card objects (like keys or permissions)

If the PIN verification has not been successfully completed prior to issuing such commands, the card refuses the request and responds with `0x6982`.

---

### Example Scenario:
Suppose a smart card applet is programmed to restrict access to a file or operation until a correct PIN is entered using the `VERIFY` command. Here's a simplified flow:

1. **Send a command before PIN verification:**
    - Example: Trying to read a protected file or access sensitive data.
    - If no valid PIN has been provided, the card responds:
        - **Response:** `0x6982` (Security Status Not Satisfied)

2. **Correct sequence with PIN verification:**
    - The user sends the `VERIFY` command with the correct PIN.
    - If the PIN verification succeeds, the user can proceed with the operation.

---

### Notes:
- The specific response (e.g., `0x6982` or custom behavior) could be defined by the applet implementation on the card. However, in compliance with smart card standards, `0x6982` is the **standard ISO/IEC 7816-4 response** for unmet security conditions like an unverified PIN.
- Some applets may allow a configurable number of incorrect PIN attempts before locking the card. When the retry limit is exceeded, the card might respond with `0x6983` (Authentication Method Blocked) instead.

---

### Commonly Used Commands in this Context:
1. **VERIFY (PIN Verification Command):**
    - Used to validate the PIN before proceeding with sensitive operations.
    - Standard command structure and processing.

2. **Protected Commands:**
    - Any subsequent command that relies on a validated PIN to satisfy the required security conditions.
