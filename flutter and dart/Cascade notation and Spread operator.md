what means double dots in Dart?

Assistant:
In Dart, double dots (`..`) represent the **cascade notation**. This allows you to make a sequence of operations on the same object. It helps improve readability by eliminating the need to repeatedly refer to the same object.

Here’s a quick example to demonstrate:

```dart
class Builder {
  int _x = 0;
  int _y = 0;
  
  void setX(int x) {
    _x = x;
  }
  
  void setY(int y) {
    _y = y;
  }
  
  @override
  String toString() {
    return 'Builder(_x: $_x, _y: $_y)';
  }
}

void main() {
  var builder = Builder()
    ..setX(10)
    ..setY(20);

  print(builder); // Output: Builder(_x: 10, _y: 20)
}
```

In the example above, `Builder()` creates a new instance and the cascade notation `..` allows you to call multiple methods (`setX` and `setY`) on that same `Builder` instance without having to reference `builder` multiple times.

what means triple dots in Dart if any?

Assistant:
Triple dots (`...`) in Dart are used for **spread operator** which allows you to insert multiple elements into a collection, such as a list or a set. This is particularly useful when you want to concatenate multiple lists or add elements from other collections into your own.

Here’s an example to demonstrate how the spread operator works:

```dart
void main() {
  var list1 = [1, 2, 3];
  var list2 = [4, 5, 6];
  
  // Use spread operator to combine lists
  var combinedList = [...list1, ...list2, 7, 8, 9];
  
  print(combinedList); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
}
```

If you need to handle potentially `null` lists safely, you can use the null-aware spread operator (`...?`). Example:

```dart
void main() {
  var list1 = [1, 2, 3];
  List<int>? list2;
  
  // Use spread operator (with null-aware) to safely combine lists
  var combinedList = [...list1, ...?list2, 7, 8, 9];
  
  print(combinedList); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9]
}
```

In the second example, if `list2` is `null`, the spread operation `...?list2` will not add anything to `combinedList`, thus avoiding a potential null reference error.
