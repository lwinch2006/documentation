How to implement callback on mouse left button down event in Flutter

Assistant:
In Flutter, using `GestureDetector` widget allows you easily listen to a variety of user inputs, including mouse button down events. You need to utilize the `onTertiaryTapDown` property that listens to left mouse button down events.

Here is an example of using `GestureDetector` to respond to a mouse left button down event:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/gestures.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: GestureDetector(
            behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,
            onTertiaryTapDown: (TapDownDetails details) {
              print('Mouse left button down');
            },
            child: Container(
              color: Colors.red,
              height: 150.0,
              width: 150.0,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
``` 

In this example, a `GestureDetector` wrapping a `Container` widget is used to listen to a mouse left button down event. And whenever you press the left mouse button down over the red container, it prints 'Mouse left button down' in the debug console.

Can Intent and Action<Intent> be used with mouse events in Flutter

Assistant:
No, `Intent` and `Actions` are a part of `Shortcuts` system in Flutter but they traditionally are not used with mouse events. You generally bind keyboard combinations to specific intents instead.

The Flutter's `Shortcuts` widget allows you to define key combinations to trigger desired commands in your application while `Actions` are used to define what happens when those shortcuts are triggered.

However if you want to handle mouse clicks, Flutter's `GestureDetector` is a widget that detects several types of user input events, including mouse button down events.

For example, here is an example of using the `GestureDetector` to handle the left click (mouse down event):

```dart
GestureDetector(
  behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,
  onTapDown: (TapDownDetails details) {
    print('Mouse left button down');
  },
  child: Container(...)
)
```

For handling keyboard key combinations with `Shortcuts` and `Actions`, here is an example:

```dart
Shortcuts(
  shortcuts: <LogicalKeySet, Intent>{
    LogicalKeySet(LogicalKeyboardKey.control, LogicalKeyboardKey.keyA): SelectAllIntent(),
  },
  child: Actions(
    actions: <Type, Action<Intent>>{
      SelectAllIntent: CallbackAction<SelectAllIntent>(
        onInvoke: (SelectAllIntent intent) => print('Ctrl + A was pressed!'),
      ),
    },
    child: ...,
  ),
)
```

In this example, when user press Ctrl + A, Flutter will print 'Ctrl + A was pressed!'. Note that this example uses a custom `Intent` (SelectAllIntent) and corresponding `Action` (CallbackAction).

how to make text style of Text widget in Flutter centered between left and right

Assistant:
To center the text inside a `Text` widget, you can use the `textAlign` property and set it to `TextAlign.center`.

Here is an example:

```dart
Text(
  'Hello, World!',
  textAlign: TextAlign.center,
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
),
```

In this example, the text 'Hello, World!' will be centered between the left and right edges of its parent. The text style is set to a `FontSize` of 24.

Remember that the `Text` widget should be in a parent that has a width otherwise it won't center. If it's the only widget in the screen, consider wrapping it with a `Center` widget to ensure it's in the middle.
