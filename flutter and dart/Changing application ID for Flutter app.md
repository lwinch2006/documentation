how to change application ID for Flutter app?

Assistant:
To change the application ID for your Flutter app, you will need to modify the application ID (also known as the package name in Android and bundle identifier in iOS) in both Android and iOS configuration files. Here's how to do it:

### For Android:
1. **Change the package name in `AndroidManifest.xml`:**

   Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and change the `package` attribute of the `<manifest>` tag to your new application ID:

   ```xml
   <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
       package="com.new.package.name">
       ...
   </manifest>
   ```

2. **Update the `build.gradle` files:**

    - Open `android/app/build.gradle` and update the `applicationId`:

      ```groovy
      android {
          ...
          defaultConfig {
              ...
              applicationId "com.new.package.name"
              ...
          }
      }
      ```

    - Also, update the package name inside `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml` and `android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml`:

      ```xml
      <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
          package="com.new.package.name">
          ...
      </manifest>
      ```

3. **Refactor the package directory structure:**

   Open `android/app/src/main/java` and `android/app/src/main/kotlin` directories, if any, and refactor the directory structure to reflect the new package name. For example, if your old package was `com.example.app`, and you want to change it to `com.new.package.name`, rename the folders accordingly.

   Use the "Refactor" feature in Android Studio for this, to avoid mistakenly breaking any references.

### For iOS:
1. **Change the bundle identifier in Xcode:**

    - Open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
    - In the project navigator, select the `Runner` project.
    - Select the `Runner` target.
    - In the `General` tab, under the `Identity` section, change the `Bundle Identifier` to the new application ID.

2. **Update the `Info.plist` file:**

   Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and verify that the `CFBundleIdentifier` entry corresponds to your new bundle identifier. There usually isn't a need to change this unless you have custom configurations:

   ```xml
   <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
   <string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
   ```

3. **Update Podfile:**

   Ensure that your `Podfile` (located at `ios/Podfile`) has the correct target name:

   ```ruby
   target 'Runner' do
       ...
   end
   ```

After making these changes, you should clean your project and rebuild it:

```sh
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

These steps should help you change the application ID for your Flutter app on both Android and iOS platforms.
