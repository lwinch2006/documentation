Http cookie has properties SameSite=None and Secure=false. What happens to it when sending from http website to https website?

Assistant:
When dealing with HTTP cookies, the **`SameSite=None`** and **`Secure=false`** properties affect how cookies are handled in cross-origin scenarios and HTTPS connections. Let’s dive into the details of your specific question:

### Scenario:
- **`SameSite=None`**: This setting explicitly allows cookies to be sent with requests that are made to a different origin (cross-site requests).
- **`Secure=false`**: This means the cookie can be sent over an **unsecured (HTTP)** connection, as it does not require HTTPS.

### When Sending From an HTTP Website to an HTTPS Website:
1. **Cross-Origin Issues Due to SameSite=None**:
    - Since the `SameSite=None` attribute explicitly allows cross-site requests, the cookie is eligible to be sent in this case, as the request is being made to a different origin.
    - However, modern browsers impose strict rules that force any cookie with `SameSite=None` to also have `Secure=true`. If `Secure=false`, the cookie will **not** be sent by the browser. This is to prevent security vulnerabilities like session hijacking.

2. **Secure Attribute Requirements**:
    - With `SameSite=None`, the absence of the `Secure` flag (i.e., `Secure=false`) will cause modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox) to block the cookie entirely, as these browsers enforce the requirement that cross-site cookies (`SameSite=None`) must also have `Secure=true`.
    - If you access the HTTPS website from the HTTP origin, the cookie with `Secure=false` won’t be sent because it fails the browser's security policy.

3. **Outcome in Modern Browsers**:
    - The cookie will **not be sent** from the HTTP website to the HTTPS website, as it violates the rule that cookies with `SameSite=None` must also be `Secure=true`.

4. **Legacy Browsers**:
    - In some older browsers or configurations that do not enforce these modern security policies, the cookie might still be sent. However, this behavior is effectively deprecated.

### Best Practices:
- To ensure cookies are transmitted securely across cross-origin requests:
    - Set `SameSite=None` if cross-site access is required.
    - Always pair `SameSite=None` with `Secure=true` to comply with modern browser security standards.
    - Use HTTPS for both the originating website and the target website to prevent insecure cookie transmission.

### Summary:
In modern browsers, if you attempt to send a cookie with `SameSite=None` and `Secure=false` from an HTTP website to an HTTPS website, the browser will block the cookie from being sent. This is because modern browsers enforce that cookies with `SameSite=None` must also have `Secure=true`.

User:
Is cookie with SameSite=None and Secure=false won't be sent both ways: from http to https website and vice versa?

Assistant:
Yes, a cookie with **`SameSite=None`** and **`Secure=false`** will not be sent **both ways** (from an HTTP website to an HTTPS website and vice versa) in **modern browsers**. Let’s break this down for both directions to clarify:

---

### **1. From HTTP Website to HTTPS Website**
- With **`SameSite=None`**, the cookie is explicitly designed to allow cross-site (or cross-origin) requests.
- However, modern browser security requirements enforce that:
    - If `SameSite=None`, then `Secure=true` is required. This ensures cookies can only be sent over a **secure HTTPS connection**.
    - If `Secure=false`, **the cookie will be blocked** when attempting to send it to the HTTPS site (despite the `SameSite=None` setting).

  **Outcome:** The cookie will **not be sent** from an HTTP website to the HTTPS website because `Secure=false` fails the security requirement for cross-origin cookies.

---

### **2. From HTTPS Website to HTTP Website**
- When a website is accessed over HTTPS, any cookie marked `Secure=true` is restricted to being sent **only over HTTPS connections**.
- In your case, the cookie is marked **`Secure=false`**, which means it could technically be sent over HTTP connections.
- However, **modern browsers block cookies with `SameSite=None` if `Secure=false`**, regardless of whether the target is HTTP or HTTPS.

  **Outcome:** The cookie will also **not be sent** from an HTTPS website to an HTTP website because `SameSite=None` combined with `Secure=false` violates modern browser security requirements.

### **Behavior Summary**
| Direction                        | Sent or Blocked?            | Reason                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTTP → HTTPS**                 | **Blocked**                 | `SameSite=None` must be paired with `Secure=true` for cross-origin requests.          |
| **HTTPS → HTTP**                 | **Blocked**                 | `SameSite=None` combined with `Secure=false` is not allowed by modern browsers.       |

---

### **Key Notes**
1. **Modern Browser Behavior:**
    - Most major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) enforce that:
        - `SameSite=None` must always be accompanied by `Secure=true`.
        - Without `Secure=true`, the cookie is blocked regardless of the origin or target.

2. **Legacy Browser Behavior:**
    - In older browsers or outdated environments, cookies with `SameSite=None` and `Secure=false` **might still be sent**. However, this behavior is deprecated and strongly discouraged.

3. **Best Practice:**
    - Always set `Secure=true` for cookies, especially if cross-site behavior (`SameSite=None`) is required.
    - Serve both the source and target websites over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.

---

### **Conclusion**
A cookie with `SameSite=None` and `Secure=false` will **not be sent in either direction** (HTTP → HTTPS or HTTPS → HTTP) because modern browsers enforce that cross-site cookies (`SameSite=None`) must also be sent over secure channels (`Secure=true`).
