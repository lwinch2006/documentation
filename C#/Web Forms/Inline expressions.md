List all possible <%%> constructions available in web forms application in ASP.NET?

Assistant:
In an ASP.NET Web Forms application, `<% %>` syntax constructs (known as ASP.NET *inline expressions*) enable you to integrate server-side code directly into your markup. Below is a comprehensive list of all `<% %>` constructs and their purposes:

---

### **1. `<% %>` - Code Block**
This construct is used to write server-side code anywhere within the ASPX markup that does not require output directly to the client.

**Example:**
```asp
<%
    string message = "Hello, World!";
    if (DateTime.Now.Hour < 12)
    {
        message = "Good Morning!";
    }
%>
```

This block will execute server-side logic but **will not output anything** to the page.

---

### **2. `<%= %>` - Response-Write Shortcut (Inline Expression)**
This construct writes the evaluated result of an expression directly to the output.

**Example:**
```asp
<p>Current Date and Time: <%= DateTime.Now %></p>
```

Equivalent to:
```asp
<%
    Response.Write(DateTime.Now);
%>
```

Use this for simple variable or method evaluations that should output to the client.

---

### **3. `<%# %>` - Data Binding Expression**
This construct is used for data binding expressions in server controls. You must call `Page.DataBind()` in the code-behind file for this to take effect.

**Example:**
```asp
<asp:Label ID="Label1" runat="server" Text='<%# DateTime.Now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd") %>'></asp:Label>
```

In the code-behind:
```csharp
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (!IsPostBack)
    {
        Page.DataBind();
    }
}
```

Common use: Data binding in `GridView`, `Repeater`, or other list-based controls.

---

### **4. `<%@ %>` - Directive**
Directives provide instructions to the ASP.NET engine for processing the page.

**Examples:**
- **Page Directive**:
  ```asp
  <%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="MyNamespace.Default" %>
  ```
  Configures the ASPX page's language, code-behind file, referenced class, etc.

- **Import Directive**:
  ```asp
  <%@ Import Namespace="System.Text" %>
  ```
  Imports namespaces into the ASPX page (like a `using` directive in C#).

- **Register Directive**:
  ```asp
  <%@ Register TagPrefix="uc" TagName="MyControl" Src="~/MyUserControl.ascx" %>
  ```
  Registers a user control or custom control.

---

### **5. `<%: %>` - HTML-Encoded Expression (ASP.NET 4.0+)**
This construct is similar to `<%= %>` but ensures that the output is HTML-encoded to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Example:**
```asp
<p>Username: <%: User.Identity.Name %></p>
```

Equivalent to:
```asp
<p>Username: <%= HttpUtility.HtmlEncode(User.Identity.Name) %></p>
```
Use `<%: %>` when injecting user-generated or dynamic content into your page to ensure it is safe to render.

---

### **6. `<%$ %>` - Expression Builder**
This construct allows you to access various framework-level resources, such as configuration settings and resource files.

**Examples:**
- Access application configuration values:
  ```asp
  <asp:Label ID="LblConfig" runat="server" Text='<%$ AppSettings:SiteTitle %>'></asp:Label>
  ```
  Retrieves the `SiteTitle` key from `web.config`.

- Access resource files (localization):
  ```asp
  <asp:Label ID="LblLocalized" runat="server" Text='<%$ Resources:ResourceFileName, ResourceKey %>'></asp:Label>
  ```

This is helpful for managing configurable settings or localization in your application.

---

### **7. `<%-- --%>` - Server-Side Comments**
This construct is used to add comments that are processed server-side and removed entirely from the final HTML sent to the client.

**Example:**
```asp
<%-- This is a server-side comment. It won't show in the client output. --%>
```

It is removed during rendering, unlike traditional HTML comments (`<!-- -->`) that are sent to the client.

---

### **8. `<!--#include virtual="" -->` or `<!--#include file="" -->` - Server-Side Include (SSI)**
This is technically part of ASP.NET but allows including another file, such as static HTML or a snippet of server-side code, into your page.

**Examples:**
- Virtual Include:
  ```asp
  <!--#include virtual="/includes/header.html" -->
  ```

- File Include (relative path):
  ```asp
  <!--#include file="header.aspx" -->
  ```

Note: This is more common in older ASP applications and not widely used in modern ASP.NET projects.

---

### **9. `<%= ResolveUrl %>` - Resolving Relative URLs**
While `<%= %>` is used, it's worth mentioning `ResolveUrl` since it's frequently used in Web Forms for resolving URLs dynamically.

**Example:**
```asp
<img src='<%= ResolveUrl("~/Images/logo.png") %>' alt="Logo" />
```

This resolves the `~/Images/logo.png` path into the full relative path based on the application root.

### **Summary of ASP.NET `<% %>` Constructs**
| Construct     | Purpose                                                                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<% %>`       | Executes server-side code without writing output.                                    |
| `<%= %>`      | Evaluates and writes the result to the client (`Response.Write` shorthand).           |
| `<%# %>`      | Data binding expression for dynamic data control properties.                         |
| `<%@ %>`      | Page directives for page settings, imports, user controls, etc.                      |
| `<%: %>`      | HTML-encodes the output and prevents XSS attacks.                                    |
| `<%$ %>`      | Expression builder for accessing resources (e.g., `AppSettings`, localization).       |
| `<%-- --%>`   | Server-side comments, removed at runtime.                                            |
| Include Tags  | Includes other files into the page using `<!--#include virtual="" -->`.              |

These constructs provide great flexibility when creating dynamic, powerful, and secure Web Forms applications. Let me know if you'd like an example of a specific construct!
