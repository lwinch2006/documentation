User:
Compare 2 functions `FlattenClaims1` and `FlattenClaims2` with regard to memory usage efficiency related to claims list?

```c#
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Security.Claims;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

namespace Sample.Extensions
{
	public static class TestExtensions
	{
		private static IEnumerable<Claim> FlattenClaims1(JToken token, string prefix)
		{
			var claims = new List<Claim>();
			
			if (token is JObject obj)
			{
				foreach (var property in obj.Properties())
				{
					var childPrefix = string.IsNullOrEmpty(prefix) ? property.Name : $"{prefix}.{property.Name}";
					claims.AddRange(FlattenClaims1(property.Value, childPrefix));
				}
			}
			else if (token is JArray array)
			{
				var index = 0;
				foreach (var element in array)
				{
					claims.AddRange(FlattenClaims1(element, $"{prefix}[{index}]"));
					index++;
				}
			}
			else if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(prefix))
			{
				claims.Add(new Claim(prefix, token.ToString()));
			}
			
			return claims;
		}
		
		private static void FlattenClaims2(JToken token, List<Claim> claims, string prefix)
		{
			if (token is JObject obj)
			{
				foreach (var property in obj.Properties())
				{
					var childPrefix = string.IsNullOrEmpty(prefix) ? property.Name : $"{prefix}.{property.Name}";
					FlattenClaims2(property.Value, claims, childPrefix);
				}
			}
			else if (token is JArray array)
			{
				var index = 0;
				foreach (var element in array)
				{
					FlattenClaims2(element, claims, $"{prefix}[{index}]");
					index++;
				}
			}
			else if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(prefix))
			{
				claims.Add(new Claim(prefix, token.ToString()));
			}
		}

Assistant:
To compare the **memory usage efficiency** of the two methods `FlattenClaims1` and `FlattenClaims2` related to `claims` list, the key difference lies in how they manage and interact with the `List<Claim>` during execution.

### `FlattenClaims1`:
- **Memory usage pattern**:
    1. A **new `List<Claim>` object** is created with each invocation of the method.
    2. As the recursion progresses, **each recursive method call creates its own `claims` list**.
    3. These lists are then merged together using `claims.AddRange()` when returning from the recursion.
    4. The intermediate lists created during recursive calls are short-lived and will add pressure to **garbage collection (GC)**, even when they are eventually discarded.

- **Efficiency Concerns**:
    - Each recursive call that creates a new list consumes additional memory temporarily, even if the final result is a single combined list. This results in increased **memory allocation and deallocation overhead**.
    - Merging smaller lists (via `AddRange`) introduces further overhead due to:
        - Copying the elements from one list to another.
        - Possible resizing of the target list if its initial capacity is exceeded during copying.

- **Garbage Collection**:
    - Since multiple intermediate lists are created and disposed of, `FlattenClaims1` increases **GC work**, especially for deep recursion or large token structures. This can lead to increased memory fragmentation.

---

### `FlattenClaims2`:
- **Memory usage pattern**:
    1. A **single `List<Claim>` object** is passed as an argument to all recursive calls.
    2. This means all recursive calls work on the **same list** without creating additional instances.
    3. Each recursive call adds claims directly to the shared list, without the need to merge smaller lists.

- **Efficiency Benefits**:
    - Since no intermediate lists are created, the **memory footprint** remains lower. Memory allocation is limited to the growth of a single list (`claims`) that stores the result.
    - There is no need to use operations like `AddRange`, which prevents inefficiencies related to copying or resizing during list merging.

- **Garbage Collection**:
    - `FlattenClaims2` minimizes garbage collection overhead because it avoids creating temporary lists, reducing memory allocation and freeing.

### Comparison Summary (`FlattenClaims1` vs `FlattenClaims2`):
| Feature                      | `FlattenClaims1`                        | `FlattenClaims2`                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **List Creation**            | Creates a new list for each recursion.  | Uses a single list throughout.   |
| **Memory Usage**             | Higher memory usage due to intermediate lists. | Lower memory usage (no new lists). |
| **GC Pressure**              | Increased, due to many temporary lists. | Significantly reduced.           |
| **Efficiency**               | Less efficient with large/deep structures. | More efficient for all scenarios. |

### Recommendation:
`FlattenClaims2` is **more memory-efficient**, especially for large and/or deeply nested JSON structures. By reusing a single shared list, it avoids the unnecessary overhead of creating and merging intermediate lists, which helps in reducing memory usage and minimizing garbage collection pressure. Thus, it is the preferred method for better scalability and performance.
