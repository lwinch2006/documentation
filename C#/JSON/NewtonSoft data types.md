User:
Which data type besides JValue and JArray can be in NewtonSoft?

Assistant:
In Newtonsoft.Json (Json.NET), besides **JValue** and **JArray**, the primary types for representing JSON content in memory are:

1. **JObject** - Represents a JSON object (a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary).
2. **JToken** - The base class from which other JSON-specific types are derived in Newtonsoft.Json, such as JValue, JObject, JArray, etc.
3. **JProperty** - Represents a single property in a JSON object (a key-value pair).
4. **JConstructor** - Represents a JSON constructor (less commonly used but allows handling JSON constructor-based syntax).

The **JObject**, **JArray**, and **JValue** are the most commonly used types for working directly with JSON structures. The **JToken** type is often used in scenarios where the exact type of JSON node is not known upfront, as it provides a common interface for working with any kind of JSON data.
