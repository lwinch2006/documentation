C# 5.0, released with Visual Studio 2012 and .NET Framework 4.5, introduced two major features focused on improving asynchronous programming. Here is a summary of the new features with short descriptions and code examples:

---

### 1. **Async and Await Keywords**
#### *Description:*
The `async` and `await` keywords make it easier to write asynchronous code thatâ€™s readable and maintainable. This allows you to perform potentially long-running operations (like I/O or network calls) without blocking the calling thread, especially useful in UI and server applications.

#### *Code Example:*
```csharp
// C#
public async Task<int> DownloadDataAsync(string url)
{
    using (var client = new HttpClient())
    {
        string result = await client.GetStringAsync(url);
        return result.Length;
    }
}
```
- `async` marks the method as asynchronous.
- `await` is used to asynchronously wait for the completion of the `GetStringAsync` method.

---

### 2. **Caller Information Attributes**
#### *Description:*
New attributes let you obtain information about the caller of a method, such as the file path, line number, and member name at compile time. These attributes are:
- `[CallerMemberName]`
- `[CallerFilePath]`
- `[CallerLineNumber]`

This feature is especially valuable for logging, debugging, and implementing INotifyPropertyChanged in MVVM patterns.

#### *Code Example:*
```csharp
// C#
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

public void Log(string message,
    [CallerMemberName] string memberName = "",
    [CallerFilePath] string sourceFilePath = "",
    [CallerLineNumber] int sourceLineNumber = 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Message: {message}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Member: {memberName}");
    Console.WriteLine($"File: {sourceFilePath}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Line: {sourceLineNumber}");
}
```
- When you call `Log("Hello")`, C# automatically fills in the caller's member name, file, and line number.

| Feature                      | Description                                              | Example                                  |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Async and Await              | Simple and readable asynchronous programming            | `await SomeAsyncMethod()`                |
| Caller Information Attributes| Obtain caller info (member, file, line) automatically   | `Log("msg", [CallerMemberName])`         |

**Note:**  
No new language features other than these were introduced in C# 5.0. Most other improvements were related to the .NET Framework and the tooling.
