Here are the key new features introduced in **C# 9.0** along with short descriptions:

---

### 1. **Records**
- **Description:** Immutable reference types primarily used for data models. Records provide built-in value-based equality, concise syntax, and immutability semantics.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
  ```

---

### 2. **Init-only Properties**
- **Description:** Properties that can only be set during object initialization, ensuring objects remain immutable after construction.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  public class Person
  {
      public string FirstName { get; init; }
  }
  ```

---

### 3. **with Expressions**
- **Description:** Enables copying an object with modifications, creating a new instance with specified property changes (typically used with records).
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  var person2 = person1 with { FirstName = "Jane" };
  ```

---

### 4. **Top-level Statements**
- **Description:** Allows omitting the `Main` method and writing statements directly in a C# file for simple programs.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
  ```

---

### 5. **Pattern Matching Enhancements**
- **Description:** Improved pattern matching, including `and`, `or`, `not` patterns as well as support for relational patterns.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  if (number is > 0 and < 100) { ... }
  ```

---

### 6. **Target-typed new Expressions**
- **Description:** The type of an object being created can be inferred from the context, reducing redundancy.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  Person p = new("John", "Doe");
  ```

---

### 7. **Covariant Return Types**
- **Description:** Methods that override a base method can return a more derived type than the base method.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  public override DerivedType GetObject() => ...;
  ```

---

### 8. **Native Integer Types (`nint`, `nuint`)**
- **Description:** Represents native-sized (platform-dependent) integers, useful for interop and low-level code.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  nint x = 5;
  ```

---

### 9. **Improved `using` Declarations**
- **Description:** Simplified resource disposal with `using` statements that work without a block scope.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  using var file = new StreamWriter("log.txt");
  ```

---

### 10. **Function Pointers**
- **Description:** Direct use of unmanaged function pointers, valuable for interoperability and high-performance scenarios.
- **Example:**
  ```csharp
  delegate*<int, int, int> addPtr = &Add;
  ```
